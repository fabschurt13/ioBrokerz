For some time, a team from the ioBroker community has been working with Bluefox to modernize and redesign the ioBroker website.
Even if some content is missing or must be taken over from the old pages, we decided to bring the page online.
At [https://www.iobroker.net](https://www.iobroker.net) the new page with blog, documentation and a new complete adapter overview with many details and information is available. Cloud links and statistics are also available there for everyone.

One of the great news is that all pages are now edited directly and the changes can be easily sent to us as a GitHub pull request. It's like a text editor on the web and you just have to sign in to GitHub with your name and email. Help to complete and improve the ioBroker documentation! Do not worry, it's easy!

<!-- SOURCE: 134404 ## Js-controller 1.5.12 offiziell verfügbar -->
After a long development and test time we are pleased to release the js-controller in version 1.5.12 for all ioBroker users in the stable repository. In addition to many optimizations and bug fixes, the js-controller 1.5.12 officially supports Node.js 10 and continues to bring new features. For this reason we recommend the use of Node.js 10.x for new installations.
Only the maxcul and wetty adapters are not yet compatible with Node.js 10.
Further information and the complete changelog can be found in the forum under [https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/22803](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/22803).
We thank all testers and bug reporters.

## Did you know? When do you have to update your Node.js and how do you do that best?
<!-- SOURCE: 148286 ## Did you know? When do you have to update your Node.js and how do you do that best? -->
Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment in which ioBroker is written.
ioBroker will not work without Node.js. When you install ioBroker, you usually start with the current LTS version of Node.js.
For Linux, changes to the current major version are automatically added when an update is triggered.
For Windows or macOS unfortunately not usually and you have to manually create from time to time.

After installing the new admin version, you will be asked if the Info Adapter should be installed, if it is not already installed. Give it a try. We will continue to use the opportunities in the future to provide notifications on current topics and maintenance on the cloud servers.

## New adapters for Siegenia and Lupusec devices
<!-- SOURCE: 674248 ## New adapters for Siegenia and Lupusec devices -->
One of the big challenges with adapter development is always getting the hardware you need to become an interested developer. The more expensive or more varied the hardware, the more difficult it becomes. Therefore, we are always pleased when the manufacturers show interest in ioBroker as a platform and support us with know-how and hardware on a loan or permanent basis.
The possibility of having a contact person in the development is priceless.
