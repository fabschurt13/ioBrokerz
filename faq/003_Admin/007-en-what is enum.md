## Cloud (Alexa & Co)
Used when working in the driver [cloud](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.cloud) (smart speakers, iftt and stuff).

## How to setup

* In the categories: you need to create a third room from the template in the admin panel, and a light function from the template.
* In the objects, find the desired switch and from the template select the name of the created room and the function light.
