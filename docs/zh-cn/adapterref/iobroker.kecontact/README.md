# 用于 KEBA KeContact P20 或 P30 和 BMW i wallbox 的 ioBroker 适配器
控制您的充电站并使用自动调节，例如使用其 UDP 协议通过光伏剩余电量为您的车辆充电。

＃＃ 安装
通过 ioBroker Admin 安装此适配器：

1. 打开实例配置对话框
2. 输入您的 KEBA KeContact 墙盒的 IP 地址
3.根据需要调整刷新间隔
4. 保存配置
5.启动适配器

＃＃ 配置
### KeContact IP 地址
这是您的 KEBA KeContact 或 BMW i Wallbox 的 IP 地址。

###固件检查
适配器将每天检查一次 KEBA 网站上是否有更新的固件可用。此信息将被打印以作为警告记录。

###被动模式
如果您想自己控制 Wallbox 并且不希望此适配器执行某些自动操作，请激活此选项。在这种情况下，所有有关 PV 自动和功率限制的后续选项都将被忽略。

### 后续墙盒
如果这是您环境中的后续墙盒，请激活此选项。目前只能主动管理一个wallbox。所有其他（单独的实例）必须选中此选项，因为只有一个实例可以接收广播消息。此墙盒/实例将在被动模式下运行。

### 加载充电会话
您可以选中此选项以定期从壁挂盒下载最新的充电会话 (30)。
v1.1.1 及以下版本的用户注意：您必须选中此选项才能继续接收充电会话！

＃＃＃ 刷新间隔
这是应该以秒为单位查询墙盒以获取新充电值的间隔。

默认值为 10 分钟，这是 KeConnect 的负载和 ioBroker 中的最新信息之间的良好平衡。

### PV 自动装置
为了给您的车辆相应地充电到剩余（例如通过光伏），您还可以定义代表剩余和主电源的状态。这些值用于计算可用于充电的安培数。通过附加值，您可以定义

* 如果您想使用充电站的X1输入来控制是全功率充电还是光伏自动充电，请切换X1选项
* 与默认 6 A 不同的最小安培数（仅适用于例如 Renault Zoe）
* 可用于开始充电的关注功率值（这意味着即使没有足够的剩余电量也会开始充电 - 建议 0 W 用于 1 相充电，500 W 至 2000 W 用于 3 相充电）
* 电流增量（建议 500 mA）
* 可以暂时用于维持充电会话的关注值（这意味着即使不再有足够的剩余，充电也会在稍后停止 - 将添加开始关注 - 建议 500 W）
* 充电会话的最短持续时间（即使剩余不再足够，充电会话将至少持续这次 - 建议 300 秒）
* 每次剩余时间不再充足时继续充电的时间（以弥补阴天的时间）

###功率限制
您还可以限制最大值。墙盒的电源以限制主电源。例如。运行夜间蓄热式加热器时，您可能必须遵守最大功率限制。
如果您输入一个值，您的 wallbox 将被连续限制以不超过您的功率限制。
最多可以指定三种电能表状态进行限制。将所有值相加以计算电流消耗。
一个额外的复选框用于指定是否包括壁箱功率（在这种情况下，壁箱功率将从状态值中减去）。

### 动态选项
此外，还有一些状态会影响动态自动光伏的行为，例如通过您自己的脚本根据您的需要更新这些值）

* kecontact.0.automatic.photovoltaics - 激活光伏自动（真）或设置为假时以最大功率为车辆充电
* kecontact.0.automatic.calcPhases - 定义用于充电计算的当前阶段数。这是 Keba Deutschland 版所必需的，可用于所有充电站的初始充电会话
* kecontact.0.automatic.addPower - 定义允许为您的车辆充电的瓦数（与选项相同）
* kecontact.0.automatic.pauseWallbox - 只要设置为 true，就会立即停止每个充电会话
* kecontact.0.automatic.limitCurrent - 将您的充电限制为指定的 mA 电流（0 = 无限制）

示例：要在不考虑剩余电流的情况下以 6A 的恒定电流为您的车辆充电，请将 PV 设置为 false 并将 limitCurrent 设置为 6000。

      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
