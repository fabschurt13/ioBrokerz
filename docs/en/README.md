# Welcome to ioBroker

## Introduction

ioBroker is the integration platform for the Internet of Things.
ioBroker is the central service for connection, evaluation and operation
of systems that would remain isolated island solutions without ioBroker.

An ioBroker system has a modular and extensible structure. A variety of
 `adapters` enables communication with over 200 different platforms
from A) like alarm systems to Z) like z-wave. Commercial products from 
hundrets of manufacures can be as easy integerated as
self created solutions - ioBroker makes almost everything possible.

## Visualization

ioBroker provides a powerful visualization platform with `VIS`.
Actual sensors values and historical graphics can be displayed. 
Live pictures of Surveillance cameras, the implementation of an alarm system,
Heating systems and air conditioning - almost everything imaginable
can also be implemented. The user has maximum
design freedom. The creation of automatisms and processes
visualization is possible without programming knowledge.
Prefabricated `widgets`, building blocks for visualization, help
Users. Controlling of devices is also possible via the visualization 
interface. The operation of the interface is tuned for on a variety 
of devices - from smartphones to wall tablets with touch function 
till personal computers - everything can be done by simple drag 
and drop.

## Cross-platform

Everyone who deals with home automation will sooner or later
discover that systems are often not perfect. Each
System has its strengths and weaknesses. ioBroker is therefore
cross-platform capable. Parallel operation with existing solutions
is possible at any time. Synergy effects can be used to get
best results. ioBroker is on almost all platforms at home. 
ioBoker can be installed on Windows Linux or as Dockerimage. 
Preconfigured installation images make the instalaltion
easy.

About an optional cloud-based interface is for the user or
System integrators remote access to a locally installed
ioBroker system 7x24h possible. The access control can by means of
Users and groups can be freely configured by the user.

## Scalable

Other systems can be connected any time. Users can add additional 
adapters during operation of the system. IoBroker itself is also scalable. 
Various ioBroker servers
can be connected to a `mutihost` system. It is even possible
to mix operating system platforms and connect SoC single-board 
computers with large multicore servers.
For systems with highest performance requirements, Redis, an
optional installable fast in-memory database can be used.

## Community

Since 2014, ioBroker has become vivitly known for its many advantages.
Support is backed by thousands of users and developers. At the 
[Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net) users and developers
share their experiences and suggestions with each other. Since ioBroker
is open source software, all source code is provided on the platform
[GitHub](https://github.com/iobroker/iobroker). Programming is done 
using JavaScript. Everyone can contribute.

?> ioBroker is not:  
   ioBroker isn't a commercial product. ioBroker is run by volunteers. 
   Therefore, the software is used on your own liability except the intention 
   of willful damage. There is no contracted support.
