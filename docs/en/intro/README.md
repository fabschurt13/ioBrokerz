ioBroker is a central server for automation tasks around smart home, building automation and Active Assisted Living. ioBroker can communicate with many existing systems and devices via modular `Adapter`. Using rules, functional processes can be created regardless of the manufacturer. Graphical interfaces provided by ioBroker help to simplify the operation or monitoring of devices.

This documentation is the central reference for all ioBroker users:

* For beginners we recommend to read some basics about IOBroker first. More about this in the chapter [Introduction] (# Introduction).
* Experienced users will find prepared images for different systems on the [Download] (../../ download) page. There are also detailed installation instructions for some hardware platforms ready.
* For all adapters, refer to the central [Adapter Reference] [../../ adapters].
* The creation of control rules is described in the section [Logic] [../ logic].

We are grateful for every helping hand. If you would like to further develop ioBroker, you will find information in [Developer section] [].
