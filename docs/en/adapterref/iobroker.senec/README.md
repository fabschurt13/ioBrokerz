# ioBroker.senec

## senec adapter for ioBroker
Targeted at the Senec Home V2.1 System.
Other systems should work, as long as they use lala.cgi. Although datapoints may differ (missing, additional, changed).

Systems that might work:
* Senec Home 4.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 6.0 Pb
* Senec Home 8.0 / Blei
* Senec Home 10.0 Pb
* Senec Home 5.0/7.5/10.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home 15.0 / Lithium
* Senec Home V2 5.0/7.5/10.0
* Senec Home V2 10.0 / Blei
* Senec Home V2.1 1ph / Lithium
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid
* Senec.Home V3 Hybrid duo
* Senec Business 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business V2 30.0 / Blei
* Senec Business 25.0 / Lithium
* Senec Business V2_2ph / Lithium
* Senec Business V2 3ph / Lithium
* ADS Tec
* OEM LG
* Solarinvert Storage 10.0 / Blei,

## Installation
You is facilitated via the ioBroker web interface and the configuration will auto-open once installation is completed.

## Setup
In addition to the adapter installation you have to add an instance of the adapter.

### Configuration 
![Main Settings](media/mainSettings.png "Main Settings")

| Field         | Description |                                                                       
|:-------------|:-------------|
|SENEC System    |Type in the IP-address of your SENEC system (FQDN is also possible if you have a working local DNS).|
|Polling Interval High Priority Data|You can change the polling interval for high priority data (how often the Adapter reads from your Senec System), too. (Default: 10 seconds)|
|Polling Interval Low Priority Data|You can change the polling interval for low priority data (how often the Adapter reads from your Senec System), too. (Default: 60 minutes)<br>
Please be careful with high-frequency polling because this can render your SENEC machine unable to connect to the SENEC server!|
|Request-Timeout|If your network requires a higher timeout for requests sent to SENEC, please change the Request-Timeout in miliseconds accordingly. (Default: 5000 miliseconds)|
|Polling Retries|In case there is an issue communicating with SENEC the adapter will retry several times. You can adjust how often it will try to read from SENEC. (Default: 10)<br>
This does not apply to Adapter Start - if the System is unavailable to Adapter will stop.|
|Polling Retry Factor|To space retries apart a bit more you can adjust the Polling Retry Factor. (Default: 2) - Example: Using default settings the 1st retry will happen 20 seconds after the initial try, the 2nd will happen 40 seconds after the 2nd try. After each successful connect to SENEC, the number of retries is reset.|

Once finished setting up configuration, hit `SAVE AND CLOSE` to leave configuration dialogue. The adapter will automatically restart.

## Usage
Here you can find a description of the states and how to use them. All states of this adapter are read-only states.
Depending on the individual system states might not be available or additional states could be there.
If a state is not documented (or only partially documented) and you know what it represents, please send a pull request (or open a ticket with the information).

## Changelog
### 1.2.0 (NoBl)
* Added datapoints for: PM1OBJ1, PM1OBJ2, EG_CONTROL, RTC, PM1, TEMPMEASURE, DEBUG, SOCKETS, CASC, WALLBOX, CONNX50, STECA (please report wrong / missing units).
* Adapter now calculates day-values for: STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_EXPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_GRID_IMPORT, STATISTIC.LIVE_HOUSE_CONS, STATISTIC.LIVE_PV_GEN, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_CHARGE_MASTER, STATISTIC.LIVE_BAT_DISCHARGE_MASTER. Calculated values can be found below the "_calc." datapoint. Information about daily values was removed from the API by SENEC in the past. So here we go again ...

### 1.1.1 (NoBl)
* Object attributes are updated to what they are expected to be: unit, description, datatype (this will break anything that still relies on datapoints being STRING that aren't meant to be string)

### 1.1.0 (NoBl)
* Updated to current adapter template
* Integrated GitHub Testing and auto npm publishing
* Some other administrative updates

### 1.0.13 (NoBl)
* Added System Description 19 for Senec.Home V3 Hybrid (Credits to noffycws)
* Added Mode Descriptions for 86-91. (Credits to noffycws)

### 1.0.12 (NoBl)
* Just set 'supportCustoms' to false so it won't show up in admin custom config.

### 1.0.11 (NoBl)
* Update to current adapter template
* Added Datapoints: PV1.MPP_CUR, MPP_VOL, MPP_POWER (former: MPP_INT which is unused at this moment but does still exist)
* Added Datapoints (please feedback any improvements for their descriptions, ...): FEATURES.SGREADY, WIZARD.SETUP_WALLBOX_MAX_TOTAL_CURRENT_BY_GRID, WIZARD.SG_READY_CURR_MODE, BMS.ERROR, BMS.RECOVERLOCKED, BMS.SERIAL, BMS.START_SELFTEST, BAT1.RESET, BAT1.SELFTEST_ACT, BAT1.SELFTEST_LIMIT, BAT1.SELFTEST_OFF, BAT1.SELFTEST_OVERALL_STATE, BAT1.SELFTEST_STATE, BAT1.SELFTEST_STEP, BAT1.SELFTEST_TIME, BAT1.SERIAL, BAT1.TRIG_ITALY_SELF, BAT1OBJ1.COMM, GRIDCONFIG.AU_SOFT_RAMP_EN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VRR_MAX, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VRR_MIN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_PERCENTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_P_MAX, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_P_MIN, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VVAR_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VWC_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.AU_VWD_VOLTAGE, GRIDCONFIG.CEI_SEGNALE_ESTERNO, GRIDCONFIG.VDELVFRTDISABLE, GRIDCONFIG.VDEURMSMAX10

### 1.0.10 (NoBl, smartpran)
* DateType objects are stored as date again
* changed WIZARD.SETUP_POWER_RULE unit to '%'
* changed name of STATISTIC.STAT_SUM_E_PU to "STAT_SUM Energy PowerUnit"
* changed name of STATISTIC.STAT_SUM_E_WB to "STAT_SUM Energy Wallbox"
* changed name of STATISTIC.LIVE_WB_ENERGY to "Live Wallbox Energy"
* changed name of STATISTIC.LIVE_PU_ENERGY to "Live PowerUnit Energy"
* changed name of WIZARD.PWRCFG_PEAK_PV_POWER to "Configured Peak PV Power"
* enforcing conversion of number values to Number(). Otherwise they are created as String in ioBroker (manually delete existing datapoints in ioBroker to change them!)
* fixed representation for temp values (off by *10)
* json delivers a non-value (apparently an error message produced by senec itself). Ignoring that.
* Added variable mpp_int to high priority and changed unit it. (smartpran)

### 1.0.9 (NoBl)
* IP types are shown as IP again.
* added datapoints for FACTORY along with more state descriptions for Battery Type, Country and System Type.
* added datapoints for GRIDCONFIG

### 1.0.8 (NoBl)
* Added more states to known states (please feedback if they need special handling (unit, special description, value modification, ...))
* Bugfix in creating debug data
* Unknown states are now reported in debug instead of info.
* Code cleanup

### 1.0.7 (NoBl)
* Reading all known states from SENEC.
* Split states into high/low priority (heavy requesting the SENEC system renders it unable to sync with the SENEC datacenter!).
* Updated adapter-core and testing versions along with current dev dependencies. Removed node 8 support.
* Added more state descriptions to manual. But need input on these and those that are still not documented.

### 1.0.6 (NoBl)
* Moved senec states and state attributes to libs
* Added missing state descriptions

### 1.0.5 (2020-03-07) (NoBl)
* Added States for: Energy: GUI_BAT_DATA_VOLTAGE, GUI_BAT_DATA_CURRENT, STAT_HOURS_OF_OPERATION; Sys_update: NPU_VER, NPU_IMAGE_VERSION, Wizard: APPLICATION_VERSION, INTERFACE_VERSION
* Readme and Documentation (EN exists, now) updated
* Changed behavior for unknown values completely. They will now be stored as string plus prefixed with "REPORT TO DEV:" so users can easily report back what needs updating.
* added handling for "st_" values in json
* added additional configuration options
* changed retry-behaviour in case of connection issues, ...

### 1.0.4 (2020-03-06)
* (NoBl) Repo URL updated
### 1.0.3 (2020-03-06)
* (NoBl) added link to documentation in german
### 1.0.2 (2020-03-04)
* (NoBl) added missing status codes (85 in total now)
* (NoBl) added status code to status message for easier reference
* (NoBl) added states for wallboxes and battery modules
### 1.0.1
* (NoBl) updated readme
### 1.0.0
* (NoBl) initial release
