# IoBroker Adapter for Zigbee devices
With the help of a coordinator for Zigbee network, based on Texas Instruments SoC cc253x (and others), will create its own network, which can join other Zigbee devices. Thanks to the direct interaction with the coordinator, the Zigbee adapter allows the control of the devices without any gateways / bridges of the manufacturers (Xiaomi / Tradfri / Hue). About functioning of the Zigbee networks can [read here (English)](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/ZigBee-network).

## The hardware
For the implementation of one of the enumerated devices / sticks is used, which are flashed with special ZNP firmware: [cc2530, cc2530, cc2530 + RF.](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Supported-sniffer-devices#zigbee-coordinator)

![](img/CC2531.png) ![](../../../de/adapterref/iobroker.zigbee/img/sku_429478_2.png) §IIIIIII_2§§ §IIIII_3§§

The required flasher / programmer and the preparation process are described in [here (English)] (https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Getting-started) or [here (Russian)](https://github.com/kirovilya/ioBroker.zigbee/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0).

The devices connected to the Zigbee network transmit their status to the coordinator and notify them of events (push-button, motion detection, temperature change). This information is displayed in the adapter under the respective objects. In addition, it is possible to send some events / status back to the Zigbee device (state change sockets and lights, color and brightness settings).

## Settings and pairing
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirovilya/files/master/config.PNG)

At the beginning, the USB port to which the cc253x is connected must be specified. How to recognize this [described here (Russian)](https://github.com/kirovilya/ioBroker.zigbee/wiki#%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0)

To connect the devices, put the Zigbee Network Coordinator in pairing mode by clicking on the green button in the adapter. Pairing mode is now active for 60 seconds. To connect the devices, pressing the button on the device to be connected is sufficient in the normal case. But there are also "special" devices. How to connect them is described [here English] (https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Pairing-devices) [or Russian](https://github.com/kirovilya/ioBroker.zigbee/wiki#%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0).

After successful pairing, the device is displayed in the adapter. If a device (from the list) has the name "undefined", then try to delete it and pair it again. If it still does not work, please write an issue.
Zigbee devices that are not in the list can be paired, but the adapter can not communicate with them.

## Additional Information
There is also a [Friendship project](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) with the same functions and the same technology, which communicates with the same devices via an MQTT protocol. If any improvements or newly supported devices are included in the Zigbee2MQTT project, those can also be added to this project. Should you notice differences, please write an issue, we will take care of it
