[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)
[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot)

This adapter uses the [ecovacs-deebot.js](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js) library.

## Models

So far, only devices that communicate with the **XMPP** protocol work.

You can check this with the state value `info.communicationProtocol` after successful connection establishment (values: `XMPP`, `MQTT`).

### Works properly
Basic commands such as `clean` (`auto`), `charge`, `stop` as well as `battery`, `charge`, `clean`  and `device` status are required for this and are not listed separately here.

| model | pause | spot | spotArea | customArea * | edge | playSound |
|------ |------ |------ |------ |------ |------ |------ |
| Deebot Ozmo 930 | x | | x | x | | x |
| Deebot Slim 2 |  | x | | | x | |

*) incl. number of `cleanings`

### Should work
* Deebot N79T
* Deebot 601
* Deebot Ozmo 610

#### These models are unlikely to work
* Deebot 900
* Deebot Ozmo 900
* Deebot Ozmo 950

## Control

### Buttons

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| charge | return to charging station |

* buttons for `0`-`9` spot areas (see 'Adapter Configuration')

#### CustomArea

    * position `0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000` the position of the charging station

#### WaterLevel
