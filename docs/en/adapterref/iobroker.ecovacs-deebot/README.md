## Usage

* Information on how to use this adapter can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot/wiki)

## Known issues

* For the Deebot Ozmo 930 it is recommended to [schedule a restart](https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/admin/instances.md#The%20page%20content) once a day because there are some reports that the connection is lost after approx. 24 hours.
* There's a strange behavior of the battery value on Deebot 900/901. It's very likely that this is a firmware bug.
  * You can use the corresponding option in the adapter config as a workaround.
* The "pause" button does not work with Deebot 710/711.
* The "stop" button does not work with Deebot 711s.
