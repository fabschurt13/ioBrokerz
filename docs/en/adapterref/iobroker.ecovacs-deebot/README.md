```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```
A reboot might be necessary before executing the next command
```bash
sudo npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```

## Usage

* Information on how to use this adapter can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ioBroker.ecovacs-deebot/wiki)

## Known issues

* There are some reports that empty cleaning logs are currently delivered by Ecovacs for Ozmo 920/950.
* For the Deebot Ozmo 930 it is recommended to [schedule a restart](https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/admin/instances.md#The%20page%20content) once a day because there are some reports that the connection is lost after approx. 24 hours.
* There are also some reports that there's a strange behavior of the battery value on Deebot 900/901. It's very likely that this is a firmware bug.
  * You can use the corresponding option in the adapter config as a workaround.
* The "pause" button does not work with Deebot 710/711.
