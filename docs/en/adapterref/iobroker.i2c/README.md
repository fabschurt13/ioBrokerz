## I2C adapter for ioBroker

Communicates with devices connected to the local system using the I2C bus.

This adapter should work on Linux boards like the Raspberry Pi, C.H.I.P., BeagleBone or Intel Edison.

## Install

Before installing, please read the [installation guide of the i2c-bus module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i2c-bus#installation).

Especially make sure, that you have properly configured and enabled I2C on your system (if needed):

-   [Configuring I2C on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/fivdi/i2c-bus/blob/master/doc/raspberry-pi-i2c.md)
-   [Configuring I2C on the Intel Edison Arduino Base Board](https://github.com/fivdi/i2c-bus/blob/master/doc/edison-adruino-base-board-i2c.md)

After you have enabled and configured I2C, you can install this adapter via ioBroker Admin:

1. Start the adapter (it must run for the discovery to work)
2. Open instance config dialog
3. Press the "Search Devices" button to discover all connected I2C devices - this will take some time, be patient!
4. Configure all found devices in their respective tabs.
5. Save the configuration (this will restart the adapter)

### Access Right Issue

Depending on the age of your ioBroker installation, the `iobroker` user (or under whatever user ioBroker is running) might not have the proper rights to access I2C.

If you have connected a device and it is not showing up in the configuration screen, please make sure the user is added to the `i2c` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG i2c iobroker
```

Note: if don't have a standard installation, replace `iobroker` in the above command with the user running your ioBroker installation (check with `ps`).

## Configuration

### Bus Number

This is the number of the I2C bus/adapter to open, 0 for /dev/i2c-0, 1 for /dev/i2c-1, ...

On Raspberry Pi 3 and 4B, this is "1".

### Generic device (03-77)

Generic I2C device. Registers can be configured depending on the hardware.

## Usage in scripts

Supported commands for `sendTo` in scripts are `search`, `read` and `write`.

`search` takes as message the bus number and returns a JSON string of an array of found addresses on the bus.

`read` takes as message an object containing the address and optional the register and number of bytes to read. It returns a buffer with the read data.

`write` takes as message an object containing the address, the data as buffer and optional the register to write. It returns the written buffer on success.

### Examples for script usage

```js
sendTo('i2c.0', 'search', 1, (ret) => {
    log('Ret: ' + ret, 'info');
});

sendTo(
    'i2c.0',
    'read',
    {
        address: 0x40,
        register: 0x02,
        bytes: 2,
    },
    (ret) => {
        log('Ret: ' + ret.inspect(), 'info');
    },
);

sendTo(
    'i2c.0',
    'write',
    {
        address: 0x40,
        register: 0x00,
        data: Buffer.from([0x44, 0x27]),
    },
    (ret) => {
        log('Ret: ' + ret.inspect(), 'info');
    },
);
```

## Compatibility

Compatibility has been tested with Raspberry Pi 3 and 4B.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please use the GitHub repository to report any bugs or request new features.

If you require a missing devcies, please provide the type of IC (brand, model, ...) and its address(es) as reported in the adapter configuration.

## Development

### VS Code & Devcontainer

This repository is set up so development can be done using VS Code and Devcontainer. Simply open the root folder of this repository with VS Code and and acknowledge to switch to Devcontainer.

### Remote I2C

If you are developing on a desktop PC and want to test I2C on a SBC (e.g. a Raspberry Pi), you can do the following:

-   Install ioBroker on the SBC with I2C
-   Install this adapter on the SBC
-   Configure the adapter instance on the SBC manually to contain the `"serverPort"` setting in `"native"`:

```json
  "native": {
    "busNumber": 1,
    "serverPort": 5555
  }
```

-   You don't need to configure any I2C devices here
-   Add an adapter instance to your desktop ioBroker (or use Devcontainer as described above)
-   Configure the adapter instance on your desktop PC manually to contain the `"clientAddress"` setting in `"native"`:

```json
  "native": {
    "busNumber": 1,
    "clientAddress": "http://<your-ip-address>:5555/rpc"
  }
```

-   Ensure you use the right IP address and port (the one configured on the device)
-   Restart the adapter instance on your desktop PC
-   The adapter will now execute all I2C commands on the configured SBC instead of locally
-   You can open the adapter instance settings on your desktop PC and scan for I2C devices like you would on the real SBC

Keep in mind that the RPC server is completely unsecured, so this should only be used for development inside a secure network!
