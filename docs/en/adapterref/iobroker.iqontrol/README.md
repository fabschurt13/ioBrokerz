## iqontrol adapter for ioBroker

Fast Web-App for Visualization.

![Example](img/screenshot1.jpg)
![Example](img/screenshot2.jpg)

Runs in any Browser.
You can save it as Web-App on iOS-Homescreen and it looks and feels like a nativ app.
ItÂ´s fully customizable.

## How to use
* Start creating views.
	You can consider views as something like a pages.
* Then create devices on these views.
	Devices have a role, that detemines the function of the device, which icons are used and so on.
	Depending on that role you can link several states to the device. These will give the device its functionality.
	If you select 'Link to other view' as role you can create links to other views. I suggest skinning Links to other views with the same Background, the linked view has.
	You can also try to use the Autocreate-Function to chose an existing device from the iobroker-object-tree. Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
* Afterwards you can create a toolbar, wich is displayed as footer.
	Toolbar-Entrys are links to views.
	The first Toolbar-Entry will be your 'Home-View' with will be loaded at start.
* To give everything a fancy style, you can upload your own images.
	You can use your images as background-images for views, or for devices.
	The free builtin demo-wallpapers are from www.pexels.com.

## Knowns issues
This is the first alpha-Release, so there may be a lot of bugs. But for me it runs completely stable.
However there are a few limitations:
- Uploading images (as background-images or for skinning device-buttons) works, but renaming and deleting does not work
- Creating and deleting sub-directories is also not working.
You can do these operations manually via ftp under iobroker/iobroker-data/files/iqontrol/userimages

Please feel free to comment and let me know, how to fix these issues!
