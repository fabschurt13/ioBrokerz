## iqontrol adapter for ioBroker

Fast Web-App for Visualization.

![Example](img/screenshot1.jpg)
![Example](img/screenshot2.jpg)

Runs in any Browser.
You can save it as Web-App on iOS-Homescreen and it looks and feels like a native app.
It's fully customizable.



## You need...
* Nodejs 8 or higher
* socketIO has to be enabled in web-adapter



## How to use
* Start creating views.
	You can consider views as something like a page.
* Then create devices on these views.
	Devices have a role, that determines the function of the device, which icons are used and so on.
	Depending on that role you can link several states to the device. These will give the device its functionality.
	If you select 'Link to other view' as role you can create links to other views. I suggest skinning Links to other views with the same Background, the linked view has.
	You can also try to use the Autocreate-Function to choose an existing device from the iobroker-object-tree. Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
* Afterwards you can create a toolbar, which is displayed as footer.
	Toolbar-Entrys are links to views.
	The first Toolbar-Entry will be your 'Home-View' with will be loaded at start.
* To give everything a fancy style, you can upload your own images.
	You can use your images as background-images for views, or for devices.
	The free builtin demo-wallpapers are from www.pexels.com.



## Known issues
This is the first alpha-Release, so there may be a lot of bugs. But for me it runs completely stable.
However there are a few limitations:
- Uploading images (as background-images or for skinning device-buttons) works, but renaming and deleting does not work
- Creating and deleting sub-directories is also not working.
You can do these operations manually via ftp under iobroker/iobroker-data/files/iqontrol/userimages

Please feel free to comment and let me know, how to fix these issues!

## Description of roles and associated states
Every device has a role, which defines the function of the device. Every role generates a set of states, which can be linked to a corresponding io-broker state.
If you use the auto-create-function, you can choose an existing device from the io-broker-object tree.  Autocreate tries to find out the role and to match as many states as possible.
This will only work for known devices. For unknown devices, and to give devices advanced features, you can add them manually via the (+)-Button or edit the devices that were created by autocreate.
To edit the role and the states of a device, click on the pencil behind the device. You will find a short description of the roles and the used states below:

### General states:
Every role has the following three states:
* **BATTERY**: *boolean* - when true, a little battery-empty-icon will be displayed
* **ERROR**: *boolean* - when true, a little exclamation-mark-icon will be displayed
* **UNREACH**: *boolean* - when true, a little wireless-icon will be displayed

Almost all roles have a STATE- and/or a LEVEL-state. In most cases this represents the main function of the device. You can assign io-broker-states of the following types to it:
* *boolean* - if possible, it will be translated to a senseful text like 'on/off', 'opened/closed' or similar. If you click on the icon of a tile it tries to toggle the boolean (for example to turn a light on or off). If it is not read-only it will generate a flip-switch in the dialog.
* *number* - will be displayed with its corresponding unit and generate a slider in the dialog.
* *string* - a text to be displayed
* *value-list* - the selected value will be displayed. If it is not write-protected it will generate a drop-down-menu in dialog. 
    * Technically a *value-list* is a value with a corresponding translation-list, defined in the 'native.states' or 'common.states' object of the datapoint:
        ````
        "native": {
            "states": {"true": "Text for true", "false": "Text for false"},
            ...
        }
        ````
    * You can create your own value list by adding the states-object to the ```` "native":{}```` part of the datapoint. This will only be read by iQontrol and has no influence to other scripts. 
    * A state-object inside of the ````"common":{}```` part will also be recognized by iQontrol, but with lower priority. If you change it here, it may have influence to other scipts. Even more it may be overwritten by the adapter that created the datapoint.

However, not every type makes sense to every role. So the STATE of a switch for example will be a boolean in most cases, to be able to be toggled between on and off. A string may be displayed, but the switch will not be functional.

### Link to other view:
* Has no further states, but it will respect the **linked-view-property**

### <img src="img/icons/switch_on.png" width="32"> Switch, <img src="img/icons/fan_on.png" width="32"> Fan:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - display and set on/off-state
* **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner

### <img src="img/icons/light_on.png" width="32"> Light:
Every light may have one or both of the following states:
* **STATE**: *boolean* - display and set on/off-state
* **LEVEL**: *number* - display and set the level of the light

Optional you can define the following states:
* For coloured LEDs (HSB-color-space):
    * **HUE**: *number* - color of the light from 0-360Â° (hue format)
    * **SATURATION**: *number* - saturation of the light (from white to pure color)
    * **COLOR_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the colored LEDs (this is only respected, if the light has both, coloured and white LEDs. If you have only one kind of LEDs the brightness is controlled by the LEVEL-State)
* For white LEDs:
    * **CT**: *number* - color-temperature of the light, if it has two shades of white
    * **WHITE_BRIGHTNESS**: *number* - the brightness of the white LEDs (this is only respected, if the light has both, white and coloured LEDs. If you have only one kind of LEDs the brightness is controlled by the LEVEL-State)
* Alternative color-spaces **not yet implemented**:
    * **HUE_MILIGHT**: *number* - Milight uses another staring-point in the hue color-cirlce: 
        ````
		MilightHue = modulo(66 - (hue / 3.60), 100) * 2.55; 
		function modulo(n, m){ 
			return ((n % m) + m) %m;
		}
        ````
    * **RGB_HUEONLY**: *string* - instead of using HUE you can use the RGB_HUEONLY-Format (hex). In this special case the RGB-Format will only accept pure saturated colors of the hue-color-circle. Mixed white is not allowed
    * **RGB**: *string* - instead of using HUE, SATURATION and COLOR_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGB-Format (hex)
    * **RGBW**: *string* - instead of using HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBW-Format (hex)
    * **RGBWWCW**: *string* - instead of HUE, SATURATION, COLOR_BRIGHTNESS, CT and WHITE_BRIGHTNESS you can use the RGBWWCW-Format (hex)
* **POWER**: *number* - power-consumption that will be displayed in small in the upper right corner
