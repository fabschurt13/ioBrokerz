There are some datapoints avaliable in 2 kinds. As a human readable text and as a number.
These numeric datafields belonging to a textfield have the same name but a "_raw" appended. 
Those fields which have a general meaning are listed below.
The fields which aren't listed vary in their meaning from device to device and aren't decumented by Miele.
If you need to refer in scripts to these fields, always use the _raw values. 
The textvalues may change in the future and also depend on the language.
Here is a list of what these raw values stand for:
