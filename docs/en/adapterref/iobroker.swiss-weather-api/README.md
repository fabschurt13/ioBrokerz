## swiss-weather-api adapter for ioBroker

Connects to the great SRG-SSR weather API (https://developer.srgssr.ch/apis/srgssr-weather).  

The SRG-SSR Weather REST API allows you to get weather forecasts and reports from more than 25.000 locations across Switzerland.

**Icons**

Weather-Icons are reused from https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/ 

Since Version 0.1.8 SRG-SSR even provides their own icons. So you can choose which Icons-Set you want to use.

**Be aware that this adapter only supports locations within Switzerland.**

### Getting started
1. Get a free accout on https://developer.srgssr.ch/ 
1. Make sure using the product "SRG-SSR-PUBLIC-API-V2" since this is their free product  
1. Go to "My Apps" and create a new App. This will create a specific ConsumerKey and ConsumerSecret
1. Find out Longitude / Latitude (decimal degrees) of the chosen location for which forecast is needed
1. Install this Adapter on ioBroker => This can take several minutes (~7min on a Raspberry Pi 3)
1. On Adapter Configuration fill in
   1. Name of App
   1. ConsumerKey of App
   1. ConsumerSecret of App
   1. Longitude / Latitude of the chosen swiss location for which forecast is needed. => Please use decimal degrees (for example ZÃ¼rich: 47.36667 / 8.5)
   1. Poll Interval in Minutes (By default 30 minutes)

The first query is made 10s after the adapter was started. After the first start, the query will be executed regularly according to the conifugation parameter (Poll Interval in Minutes)
