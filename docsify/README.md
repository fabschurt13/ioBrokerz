# ioBroker Documentation Prototyping System

This is a prototyping system for the GUI-development of the ioBroker
documentation based on [doksify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/).

To use the documenation, install docsify with

~~~
npm i docsify-cli -g
~~~

If you want to preview the content, start a local server with

~~~
docsify serve docs
~~~

with `docs` as the root folder of the website.

You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

For more information on docsify check out [docsify-cli](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli)
and [https://docsify.js.org](https://docsify.js.org).

Have a nice day!
