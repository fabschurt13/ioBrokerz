## Installation
**Important!**
This adapter cannot be installed directly from github. Only from npm.

## Usage
It is very important to know, that adapter shows only devices that added to some categories, like *rooms* or *function*.
Better if every device belongs to both categories. Because every device has a type and place.


## Supported types
### Switch
### Dimmer
### Media player
### Volume
### Group volume

## ToDO
* Cams (over extra Adapter)
* events (over extra Adapter)
* Main screen
* Charts
* Narrow menu
* vacuum cleaner
* show bar for sliders to indicate position
* support of quality codes
* Show images / URL
* Make a photo
* Maps (OpensStreetMap)
* Weather maps
* Add custom URLs as tile (image or IFRAME)
