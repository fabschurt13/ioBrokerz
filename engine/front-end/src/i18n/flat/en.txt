In order to finance the hosting, we link product offers from affiliated partner shops via so-called affiliate links. These are marked with an asterisk '*'. If a user purchases a product in one of the partner shops via such an affiliate link, we receive a sales commission from the provider, e.g. from Amazon, GearBest and others. The price remains unchanged for the user in any case.
